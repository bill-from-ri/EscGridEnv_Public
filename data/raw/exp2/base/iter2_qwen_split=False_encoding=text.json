The agent should avoid moving onto yellow cells unless absolutely necessary, and only then move directly to a cyan cell if it turns purple as a result of stepping on yellow.\n2) Push orange objects out of the way when possible, but be mindful that pushing an orange object onto a yellow cell will turn it into a purple cell. The agent should avoid causing this transformation unless there is no other option to reach the Goal without doing so.\n3) Once past the initial row of obstacles, move DOWN as far as possible until encountering more obstacles or reaching the goal.\n4) If at any point an orange object blocks the path and cannot be avoided by going around, push it in a direction that does not create new barriers for itself. \n5) Continue moving RIGHT to reach the cyan cell next to Goal. This will revert any purple entities back to their original color if necessary.\n6) Finally, move DOWN one last time to reach the green Goal object.",
