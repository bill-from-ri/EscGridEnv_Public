Since we need to align the agent with the goal object in terms of x and y coordinates, we'll start by moving vertically down to match the y-coordinate. The difference between the y-coordinates (y-goal - y-agent = 13-8=5) indicates that the agent needs to move downwards five times. Once aligned on the vertical axis, horizontally move towards the right from the current x-coordinate (x=5) to reach the goal's x-coordinate (x=19), which is a total of 14 moves to the RIGHT.",

Specifically, from its current position at (6, 5), the agent must move DOWN 4 times (to y = 9) and then RIGHT 12 times (to x = 18). However, there's a wall blocking the direct path between the agent\u2019s initial location and the goal object in both vertical and horizontal directions. Therefore, it needs to first navigate around this obstacle by moving DOWN to avoid the obstruction initially and follow an indirect route. Since navigating around walls requires finding an unobstructed passage, the plan will involve identifying a safe path through brown spaces to reach (18,9). A suggested sequence is: move down until reaching a passable position relative to the wall obstruction, then proceed right while moving down vertically as needed to circumvent further obstacles.",

        "solve_plan": "First, identify the goal object as the green cell located at (17, 8). The agent is currently obstructed by orange blocks and must first clear a path to reach the green block. To do so, move the agent right 2 times until it reaches x=6. Then move down 3 times until y = 9. From there, move left twice to position x=7. Now the agent should be next to an orange cell that blocks its way directly to the goal. The agent needs to push this block by moving DOWN once to place the block on the yellow square, turning it purple and allowing it to pass through cyan squares when pushed or moved onto them. Then move left once to position x=6, then down twice to y=10 to clear the next obstructing orange block. Move right 2 times to reach x=8, and then move down 3 times to y = 14. From there, move right 5 times to x = 13. Finally, move up once to place this purple-obstructing block on the cyan cell to make it disappear. Now move up twice to position y=12, and left twice to reach x=11. Next, move up four more steps to align with goal's row at y=8, then right 6 times to reach the goal.",
