The agent starts from a position marked by 'agent' and there's an orange block that needs special handling due to its interaction with pink and blue blocks. Here\u2019s how we can break down the steps: First, identify that the goal is at (16,9) and the agent is located at (5,8). To reach the x-coordinate of 16 from 5, the plan involves moving right 11 times to align with the green object on the x-axis. As for the y coordinate, since the target cell is already directly below or above within reachable brown blocks, no vertical movement adjustment in terms of steps is needed explicitly but observe that it's just a single-step down move once we get horizontally aligned. After moving right 11 times to reach column 16, the agent will be either at (16,8) or needs one more step down to align perfectly with the goal. If there are no obstructions like walls or orange blocks in the way and since brown is passable, the exact path involves simply following horizontal alignment first then minor vertical adjustment if necessary. However, an important detail here is that there's a pink square at (15, 2) which might require manipulation of any obstructing blue block to clear a path if such a situation arises during the route, but since current setup doesn't necessitate it, primary focus should be on simple movement to goal.",
