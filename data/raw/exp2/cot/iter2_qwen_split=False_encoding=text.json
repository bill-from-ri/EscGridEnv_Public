Push the orange object onto the pink object at (1, 12), which is not feasible as it's too far and there are walls in between so instead move towards the blue object directly.\n\nNext, go LEFT from the current position till you find a way around the blue box i.e., move UP once to reach x=13, y=5 and then move LEFT 12 times to go around any blocking objects or use another orange block if available nearby for pushing. Alternatively, push the orange block directly onto the pink (if it\u2019s within range) from a closer distance after moving down/right.\n\nLastly, move towards the green object: Move DOWN from y=5, 9-5 = 4 times to align vertically with goal and then move RIGHT from x=13, 19-13=6 times.
