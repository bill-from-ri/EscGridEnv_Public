The agent needs to move right 13 times (from x=6 to x=19), then it has to move down 15 times (from y=5 to y=20) to reach the Goal object. However, since there's a brown border that blocks direct movement between these points, the agent must find an opening or an alternative route. From the observation, there is an opening at (18,13), but this doesn't directly connect to the agent's initial position or the goal. Assuming we need to use this opening for navigating around the obstacle: first move right until reaching x=17 and then move down to y=13 to reach the opening, move through it, then continue moving in a straight line towards the Goal.",
