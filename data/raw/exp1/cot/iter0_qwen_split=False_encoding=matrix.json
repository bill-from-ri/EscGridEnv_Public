However, since no specific color for the Goal object was mentioned in the text other than the 'agent', 'brown', and 'orange', let's identify the closest non-'brown' or non-agent cell which seems like a potential goal. Let's assume that this particular grey cell is our target as it does not have any identifying markers of enclosure around it and appears accessible (no solid 'brown' wall blocking from the agent's current position). The agent is at coordinates (6, 8) with respect to the matrix indexing starting from (0,0). Let's assume goal is on a grey cell at approximately (17,9), since it's near the green and blue objects and not enclosed by brown blocks. \n\nThe plan involves moving the agent horizontally first towards x=16 (since x=6 to x=17 needs 12 steps right) and then vertically up one space to align y-coordinates from y=8 to y=9, since there's an opening visible above it. Thus the plan is: Move RIGHT 12 times followed by moving UP once.",
