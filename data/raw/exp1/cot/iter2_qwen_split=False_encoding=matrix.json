The goal is located in this area outside of the main enclosed space where other objects are present. Given the position of the agent at (5,6) and the green object being the target Goal object at (19, 14), we can derive a plan as follows: Firstly, since there's an obstacle to move directly right or down from the starting point due to brown borders, we must first align with the opening in the border by moving DOWN. The agent needs to move DOWN until it reaches y=13, which means moving 8 steps down (since 13 - 5 = 8). Then, move RIGHT towards x=19 from x=5 via the gap at (18, 13) but not getting stuck at any obstacles or edges. After reaching x=18, move DOWN to y=14 and then one step right to reach x=19 where the green object is located.",

We need to identify the goal's location which from your description appears to be the 'green' object at coordinates (10, 4). The plan involves moving the agent horizontally and vertically towards this point without colliding with any brown borders or other objects: First, move UP twice to go from y=6 to y=4. Next, move LEFT two times to align x-coordinate from 8 to 6 as there's no obstacle along the way. Finally, move LEFT again until it reaches the goal at (10,4), which would require moving left one more time due to an initial misalignment in steps count or a need to correct the path by checking if any intermediary step is blocked. However, given the provided information and assuming direct movement without obstacles between agent's start point and green object's location, there might be a reevaluation of movements based on actual grid layout analysis for accuracy.",
