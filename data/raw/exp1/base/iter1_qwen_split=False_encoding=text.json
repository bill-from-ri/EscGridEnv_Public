Given the information provided does not specify where the Goal object is located, I will base my plan on reaching an unambiguous spot - the green object at (19, 9), as it's outside the enclosure and uniquely accessible without barriers.

From the observation, it seems that there are multiple orange objects and one yellow object located within the environment but no explicit mention of what the Goal object is in terms of color or type. To proceed with planning, I'll assume the goal is to reach an unnamed target point (x, y) which we need to deduce from context clues if not explicitly stated. Given that there are orange objects and a yellow object, these can be distractors unless specified otherwise. Since no specific Goal object was indicated other than that it should match the agent's position at some cell (x,y), I'll infer based on proximity or unique positioning of any special items or cells (i.e., opening in the enclosure). The unique detail here is an unenclosed path leading to an orange object at location (18, 7) and since this point also has an exit out of the border, it could be our target Goal location if no other specifics are given. Therefore, moving towards (18, 7) will likely achieve the goal of reaching a unique cell outside normal barriers.",
