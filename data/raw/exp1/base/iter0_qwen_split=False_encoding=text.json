The agent must first move right from its current location at (5, 8) until it reaches column 9 where the green object is located (ignoring other objects in between).

My first assumption will be to consider the Goal object to be at location (10, 12) as it's towards the right and down from the agent's starting position and surrounded by many orange objects which may imply its importance or relevance in this context.

The agent must first navigate through the open space towards the goal while avoiding obstacles and borders. To do this efficiently: move left once until reaching column 7, then move up repeatedly till reaching row 8, proceed left into the next column (column 6) to reach past the brown border at (18,9).
