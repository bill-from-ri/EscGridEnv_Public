Since there is no visual clue about where the goal might lie from the given map snippet, let's assume for planning purposes that the goal token is located at an unoccupied cell in proximity; a common target location would be on or adjacent to the boundary of obstacles since goals are often placed strategically outside hazardous zones.\n\nFrom (4, 17), considering there are 'brown' obstacles blocking direct downward movement and no immediate visible path to a clear goal placement from the provided map snippet, a reasonable inference might involve moving horizontally rightwards or vertically upwards depending on grid boundaries and potential hidden information not shown in this map segment.",

For this plan, let us assume that the 'Goal' is a cell marked uniquely by a different identifier not present currently. However, if we infer based on common practice, often in GridWorlds, an unoccupied space near significant elements can be considered for goal placement or a specific color like green could indicate the Goal (as it's distinct from others). Given the grid provided and assuming that 'green' signifies the Goal object, here is how to proceed: The agent starts on a cell with coordinates relative to its position. From the observation, the agent ('agent') is at row 8, column 16. The only green ('Goal') is located at row 9, column 20 in this grid layout (assuming that indexing starts from 0).
