However, for demonstration purposes, let's assume that the goal is to reach one of the orange objects, say the first mentioned at coordinates (6,10), since it's logically the nearest in the sequence and there are many other options available as goals once this approach is clear. The agent starts at location (5,8). First, move down twice to get from (5, 8) to (7, 8). Then, move right twice to reach (7,10), which is where our assumed goal orange object is located.",

Given the layout, the closest distinct non-orange objects are the cyan object at (18, 9) and the green object at (19, 9). Since both these goals would involve navigating through an opening in the border at (18,7), I will choose the cyan object as it is closer to the agent's initial position.
