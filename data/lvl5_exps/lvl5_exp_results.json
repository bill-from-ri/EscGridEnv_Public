Given this uncertainty and considering movement feasibility first, I'll assume the goal is one of these objects in order from closest to furthest: yellow (13,8), cyan (18, 8) or green (19,8). Since there's an opening at (18, 8) which makes it easier for the agent to pass through compared to directly going straight right to reach (19,8), I'll assume Goal is either yellow object at (13, 8) or cyan object at (18, 8).\n\nGiven this, my high-level plan will be as follows: Move left until reaching column 8. Then, move down until hitting the enclosure barrier. From there, move right until reaching the opening in the enclosure, and then continue moving right to reach the goal object. I'll assume the cyan object is the Goal since it's closer and has an accessible path.\n\nHigh-level plan summary: Move left to column 8, then down until encountering a barrier, use the opening at (18,8) to move horizontally towards the cyan object which is in that row.",

Next, notice there's a Key located at (13, 8) and a cyan (KeyDoor) at (18, 8), suggesting that moving to the goal directly isn't possible due to the closed KeyDoor. Therefore, first approach the yellow object to pick up the key. Then move rightwards towards the cyan object while maintaining the same vertical level (y=8). After picking up the key and reaching the cyan object's location, open the KeyDoor by moving onto it which destroys the Key. Finally, after opening the door, proceed towards the Goal at (19, 12).",
