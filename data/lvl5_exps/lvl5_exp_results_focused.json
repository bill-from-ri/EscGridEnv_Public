To open the KeyDoor, the agent needs to pick up the yellow Key. The path to the yellow Key is clear, so align the agent on the horizontal axis (y=8) by doing nothing. Then, move the agent to reach the Key (x=13) by moving RIGHT 8 times. After picking up the Key, the agent will be colored purple. Then, move BACK to the original position (x=5) by moving LEFT 8 times. Next, align the agent on the horizontal axis (y=8) again by doing nothing. Move the agent to reach the cyan KeyDoor (x=18) by moving RIGHT 13 times. After opening the KeyDoor, move DOWN 2 times to reach the goal.",

        "solve_plan": "Preliminary steps: Determine that the green object is the Goal object. Then, determine that the path from the agent's current position to the green object is blocked by a cyan KeyDoor. To unblock the path, first pick up the yellow Key at (13, 8) by moving RIGHT 8 times. This will color the agent purple. Next, align the agent on the horizontal axis (y=8) since it is already aligned. Then, move the agent to reach the cyan KeyDoor (x=18) by moving RIGHT 5 times. When the agent moves onto the cyan object, the KeyDoor opens and the Key is destroyed. Finally, align the agent on the vertical axis (x=19) by moving DOWN 2 times, then move UP 1 time to reach the goal.",
