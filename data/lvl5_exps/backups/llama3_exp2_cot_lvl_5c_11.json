Because the agent is at y=8, it must move DOWN 10 - 8 = 2 times. Next, move to pick up the Key (x=13, y=8). Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Pick up the Key by moving into its space and become purple. Then, move to reach the cyan object (x=18, y=8) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Open the cyan KeyDoor by moving onto it, which will destroy the Key. Finally, move to reach the goal (x=19, y=10) by moving RIGHT and then UP. Because the agent is now at x=18, it must move RIGHT 1 time and then UP 2 times.",
