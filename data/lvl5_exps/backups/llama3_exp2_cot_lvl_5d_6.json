Because the agent needs to reach the cyan object before reaching the goal, align the agent on the horizontal axis (y=8) by doing nothing as the agent is already at y=8. Next, move the agent to pick up the yellow Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, move the agent to reach the cyan object (x=18) by continuing to move RIGHT. The agent is already at x=13 so it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. After that, move onto the cyan KeyDoor which will open and destroy the Key. Next, align the agent on the vertical axis (y=11) by moving UP. Because the agent is at y=8, it must move UP 11 - 8 = 3 times. Finally, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. The agent is already at x=18 so it must move RIGHT 1 time.",
