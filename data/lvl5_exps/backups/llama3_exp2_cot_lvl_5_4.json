Next, pick up the yellow key by moving RIGHT to reach it at x=13. The agent must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, while holding the Key, move RIGHT again to reach the cyan KeyDoor at x=18. The agent must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. This will open the KeyDoor and destroy the Key. Finally, move RIGHT one more time to reach the goal (x=19).",
