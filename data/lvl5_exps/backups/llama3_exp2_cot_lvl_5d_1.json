Then, move to align with the cyan object on the horizontal axis (y=8) by moving UP. Because the agent is at y=11, it must move UP 11 - 8 = 3 times. Next, move the agent to reach the KeyDoor (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Then, move onto the KeyDoor to open it and destroy the Key.
