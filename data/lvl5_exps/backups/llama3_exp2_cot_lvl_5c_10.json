Since the agent is blocked by a cyan KeyDoor at (18, 8), it must first pick up the yellow Key at (13, 8) to unlock the KeyDoor. Move RIGHT 8 times to reach the Key. Pick up the Key and turn purple. Next, move LEFT 8 times back to the original x-position. Then, move DOWN 2 times to align with the y-axis of the KeyDoor (y=8). Move RIGHT 13 times to reach the KeyDoor at (18, 8) and unlock it. Finally, move DOWN 2 times and then RIGHT 1 time to reach the Goal object at (19, 10).",
