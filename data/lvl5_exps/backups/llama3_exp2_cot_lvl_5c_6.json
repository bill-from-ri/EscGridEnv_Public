Since the cyan object is a KeyDoor and the yellow object is a Key, the agent must first pick up the Key by moving to the same cell as the yellow object (x=13). To do this, move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Next, move UP 0 times since the agent is already at y=8. Then, move to the cyan object (x=18) by moving RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Since the agent is holding the Key and moves onto the cyan object, the KeyDoor opens and the Key is destroyed. Finally, move DOWN 10 - 8 = 2 times and then move RIGHT 19 - 18 = 1 time to reach the goal.",
