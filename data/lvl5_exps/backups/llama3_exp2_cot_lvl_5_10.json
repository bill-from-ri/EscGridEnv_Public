Because the cyan object is a KeyDoor and it is on the path to the goal, the agent must first pick up the yellow key by moving RIGHT to reach the yellow object (x=13). Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Next, while holding the Key, the agent can move onto the cyan KeyDoor and open it. Then, align the agent on the horizontal axis (y=8) which is already aligned. Finally, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=13 after picking up the key, it must move RIGHT 19 - 13 = 6 times.",
