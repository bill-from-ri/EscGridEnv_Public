Because the agent is at y=8 and the goal is at y=11, it must move DOWN 11 - 8 = 3 times. Next, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 19 - 5 = 14 times but since there's an opening in the enclosure at (18, 8), it needs to move RIGHT 18 - 5 = 13 times and then move DOWN 1 time.",
