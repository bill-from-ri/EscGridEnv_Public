    "solve_plan": "First determine that the green object is the Goal object. Align the agent on the vertical axis (x=19) by moving RIGHT until it reaches the opening in the enclosure at (18, 8). Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 times to reach the opening. Next, move DOWN to align with the goal object's y-axis. The agent needs to move DOWN 2 times since it's currently at y=8 and the goal is at y=10. Finally, move RIGHT once more to reach the goal (x=19).",
