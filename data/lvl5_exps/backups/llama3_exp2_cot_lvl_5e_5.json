Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Next, move UP to align with the cyan KeyDoor (y=8) since we are already on the same horizontal axis. Then, move RIGHT to reach the cyan object and open the door by moving onto it. Finally, move DOWN to reach the goal (y=12) and then move RIGHT to reach the green object (x=19). Because the agent is at y=8 after opening the door, it must move DOWN 12 - 8 = 4 times. Then, because the agent is at x=18, it must move RIGHT 19 - 18 = 1 time.",
