Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Next, move DOWN to align on the vertical axis (y=11) because the green object is located at (19, 11). Because the agent is at y=8, it must move DOWN 11 - 8 = 3 times. Then, move RIGHT to reach the goal (x=19) because the cyan object at (18, 8) is a KeyDoor and will open when the agent reaches it while holding the key. Because the agent is at x=13 after picking up the key, it must move RIGHT 6 times to reach the KeyDoor, then another move RIGHT to reach the goal. ",
