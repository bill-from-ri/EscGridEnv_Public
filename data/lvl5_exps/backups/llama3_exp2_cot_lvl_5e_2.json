Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times to reach the yellow key. Then, move DOWN to align with the cyan KeyDoor on the vertical axis (x=18). Since the agent will be at y=7 after picking up the key, it must move DOWN 1 time. Next, open the KeyDoor by moving RIGHT onto the cyan object. Finally, move DOWN to reach the goal (y=12) because the agent is currently at y=8, it must move DOWN 4 times.",
