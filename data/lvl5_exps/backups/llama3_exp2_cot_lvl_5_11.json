Next, the agent must pick up the yellow Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5 and the Key is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, while holding the Key, the agent can move to reach the cyan KeyDoor (x=18) by moving RIGHT again. Because the agent will be at x=13 after picking up the Key, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times more. After opening the KeyDoor and destroying the Key, the agent can finally move to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT one last time.",
