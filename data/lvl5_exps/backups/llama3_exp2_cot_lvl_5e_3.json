Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, while holding the purple Key, move the agent to reach the cyan KeyDoor (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Next, move onto the cyan KeyDoor to open it and destroy the Key. Then, move DOWN one space to align with the green Goal object on the vertical axis (y=12). Finally, move RIGHT one space to reach the goal.",
