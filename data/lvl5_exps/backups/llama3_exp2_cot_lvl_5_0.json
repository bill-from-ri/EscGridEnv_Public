Because the cyan object is a KeyDoor and the yellow object is a Key, the agent must pick up the Key by moving to the yellow object location (13,8) on the horizontal axis (y=8). The agent is at x=5, so it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Next, hold the Key and move to the cyan object location (18,8) to open the KeyDoor. Then, move through the opened KeyDoor and reach the goal by moving RIGHT 1 more time.",
