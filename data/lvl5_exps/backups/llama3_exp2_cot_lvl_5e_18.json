Align the agent on the horizontal axis (y=8) since the yellow object, cyan object, and the opening in the enclosure are all at y=8. Since the agent is already at y=8, no action is required. Next, move to pick up the Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5 and the yellow object is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, move to reach the cyan object by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=13 and the cyan object is at x=18, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. After picking up the Key, the agent becomes purple. Now, move onto the cyan object which is a KeyDoor. The KeyDoor opens and the Key is destroyed. Next, align the agent on the vertical axis (x=19) by moving UP. Because the green object is at y=12 and the agent is now at y=8, it must move UP 12 - 8 = 4 times. Finally, move to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=18, it must move RIGHT 19 - 18 = 1 time.",
