No action needed for alignment. Next, move the agent to reach the yellow object by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. After picking up the Key, the agent will be purple. Move DOWN one space to align with the cyan object. Finally, move RIGHT one space to open the KeyDoor and destroy the Key. Then, move UP one space and then RIGHT to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=18, it must move RIGHT 1 time.",
