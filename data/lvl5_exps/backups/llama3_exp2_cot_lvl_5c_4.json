The agent does not need to move vertically. Next, move the agent to pick up the Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times to reach the yellow object. After picking up the Key, the agent will be colored purple. Then, move the agent to open the KeyDoor by moving RIGHT again. Because the agent is now at x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times to reach the cyan object. After opening the KeyDoor, the agent can move through it. Finally, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT again. Because the agent is now at x=18, it must move RIGHT 19 - 18 = 1 time to reach the green object. Then, move DOWN to align with the green object on the vertical axis (y=10). Because the agent is currently at y=8, it must move DOWN 10 - 8 = 2 times.",
