Next, move to pick up the Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. After picking up the Key and becoming purple, move RIGHT again to reach the cyan object (KeyDoor). Open the KeyDoor by moving onto it. Finally, move DOWN once and then move RIGHT to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=18 after opening the door, it must move RIGHT 1 time.",
