Next, move to pick up the yellow Key object by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5 and the Key is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, move to reach the cyan KeyDoor object while holding the Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent will be at x=13 after picking up the Key, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. After that, move DOWN to open the KeyDoor and destroy the Key since the agent is now purple. Then, move RIGHT again to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent will be at x=18 after opening the KeyDoor, it must move RIGHT 19 - 18 = 1 time.",
