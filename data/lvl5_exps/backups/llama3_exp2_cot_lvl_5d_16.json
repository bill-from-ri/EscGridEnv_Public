Because the agent is at y=8 and the goal is at y=11, it must move UP 11 - 8 = 3 times. Next, align the agent on the vertical axis (x=13) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, pick up the yellow Key by moving into its space. Move to the cyan KeyDoor and open it with the Key. Finally, move to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=18 after opening the KeyDoor, it must move RIGHT 1 time.",
