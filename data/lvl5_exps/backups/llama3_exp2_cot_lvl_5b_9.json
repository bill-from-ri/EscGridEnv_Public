Next, move the agent to reach the yellow Key (x=13) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, pick up the yellow Key by moving into its space. Now the agent is colored purple. Move the agent back to the opening in the enclosure (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is currently at x=13, it must move RIGHT 5 times. Next, move the agent DOWN to align with the cyan KeyDoor (y=8). Finally, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=18, it must move RIGHT 1 time.",
