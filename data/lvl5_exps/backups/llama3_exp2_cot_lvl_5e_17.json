Because there is a cyan object (KeyDoor) blocking the path to the goal, the agent must first pick up the yellow object (Key) by moving RIGHT. The distance between the agent and the Key is 13 - 5 = 8. Next, move DOWN to align with the KeyDoor at y=8. Then, move RIGHT to reach the KeyDoor at x=18. Because the agent is holding the Key, it will open the KeyDoor when moved onto it. Finally, move DOWN to reach the goal (y=12) and then move RIGHT to reach the goal (x=19).",
