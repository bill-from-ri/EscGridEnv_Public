Next, move the agent to pick up the Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, while holding the Key, move DOWN one space to align with the cyan object (y=7). Move RIGHT again to reach the cyan object and open the KeyDoor. Finally, move DOWN two spaces to reach the goal (y=12) and then move RIGHT one space to reach the green object.",
