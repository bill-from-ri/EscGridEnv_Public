Because the cyan object is a KeyDoor, the agent must first pick up the yellow key by moving RIGHT to reach x=13 and then move DOWN to reach y=8. Next, align the agent on the horizontal axis (y=8) since it's already aligned. Then, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=13 after picking up the key, it must move RIGHT 19 - 13 = 6 times. Finally, move DOWN to open the KeyDoor and reach the Goal object.",
