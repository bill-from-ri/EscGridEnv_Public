Next, move to pick up the yellow Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, move to reach the cyan KeyDoor while holding the Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is already at x=13 after picking up the Key, it doesn't need to move horizontally. Then, move DOWN to open the KeyDoor and destroy the Key. Finally, move RIGHT to reach the goal (x=19) because the agent is already at y=9. It must move RIGHT 1 time.",
