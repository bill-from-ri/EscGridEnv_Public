Because the agent is at x=5 and the Key is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, move to the cyan object (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is already at y=8, no vertical movement is needed. It must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. After picking up the Key and reaching the cyan object, the KeyDoor will open and the Key will be destroyed. Finally, move to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=18, it must move RIGHT 1 time.",
