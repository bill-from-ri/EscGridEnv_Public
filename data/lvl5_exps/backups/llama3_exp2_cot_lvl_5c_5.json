Next, move to pick up the Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5 and the yellow object is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, move to reach the cyan object (KeyDoor) by moving RIGHT. The agent is already at the correct y-coordinate, so no vertical movement is needed. Because the agent is at x=13 and the cyan object is at x=18, it must move RIGHT 5 times. Once the KeyDoor opens, move DOWN to align with the green object's y-coordinate (y=10). Then, move RIGHT to reach the goal (x=19). Because the agent is at x=18, it must move RIGHT 1 time.",
