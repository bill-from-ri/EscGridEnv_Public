Align the agent on the horizontal axis (y=8) since the goal's y-coordinate is already aligned with the agent's y-coordinate. Next, move the agent to reach the yellow Key (x=13) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, pick up the yellow Key by moving into its space. After picking up the Key, move the agent to reach the cyan KeyDoor (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is already at x=13 after picking up the Key, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Then, open the cyan KeyDoor by moving onto it while holding the Key. Finally, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=18 after opening the KeyDoor, it must move RIGHT 19 - 18 = 1 time.",
