Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, move UP to align with the cyan KeyDoor (18,8) by moving UP 0 times since y=8. Next, open the KeyDoor by moving onto it. Move DOWN to align with the horizontal axis (y=11) by moving DOWN 1 time. Finally, move RIGHT to reach the goal (x=19). Because the agent is at x=18, it must move RIGHT 19 - 18 = 1 time.",
