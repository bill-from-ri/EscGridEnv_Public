Then pick up the Key by moving into its space. Next, move to the cyan object (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is currently at x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. After that, move onto the cyan object to open the KeyDoor and destroy the Key. Then, align the agent on the vertical axis (y=12) by moving DOWN. Because the agent is at y=8, it must move DOWN 12 - 8 = 4 times. Finally, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=18, it must move RIGHT 1 time.",
