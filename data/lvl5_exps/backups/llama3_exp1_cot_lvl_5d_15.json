Because the agent is at y=8 and the goal is at y=11, it must move DOWN 11 - 8 = 3 times. Next, align the agent on the horizontal axis (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 14 times to reach the opening in the enclosure at (18, 8), and then move RIGHT one more time to reach the goal.",
