Align the agent on the vertical axis (y=9) by moving DOWN one space and then UP one space because the agent is at y=8 and it needs to be at y=9, so it must move a total of 1 time in the vertical direction. Next, align the agent on the horizontal axis (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 14 times.",
