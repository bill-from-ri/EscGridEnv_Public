Because the agent is at y=8 and the goal is at y=10, it must move DOWN 2 times. Next, pick up the yellow Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5 and the yellow object is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, move to reach the cyan KeyDoor (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=13 and the cyan object is at x=18, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. After picking up the yellow Key, the agent will be purple and can open the cyan KeyDoor. Finally, move to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=18, it must move RIGHT 1 time.",
