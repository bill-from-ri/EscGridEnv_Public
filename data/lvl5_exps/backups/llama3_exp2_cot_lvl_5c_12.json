While holding the Key, the agent is colored purple. Next, align the agent on the horizontal axis (y=10) since the green object is at y=10. Move DOWN 2 times to reach y=10. Then, move the agent to reach the cyan object (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 5 times.
