Because the agent is at y=8, it must move DOWN 10 - 8 = 2 times. Next, move the agent to pick up the Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5 and the yellow object is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, move the agent to reach the KeyDoor by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. After that, move DOWN to open the KeyDoor and destroy the Key. Finally, move RIGHT to reach the goal (x=19). Because the agent is now at x=18, it must move RIGHT 19 - 18 = 1 time.",
