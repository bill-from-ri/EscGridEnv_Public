Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. After picking up the key and becoming purple, move DOWN one space to align with the cyan KeyDoor at y=8. Next, move RIGHT to reach the cyan object at (18,8) and open the door by moving onto it. Then, move UP one space to align with the green object's y-coordinate at y=12. Finally, move RIGHT to reach the goal (x=19). Because the agent is currently at x=18 after opening the door, it must move RIGHT 1 time.",
