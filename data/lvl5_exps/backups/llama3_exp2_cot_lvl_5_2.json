Next, align the agent on the horizontal axis (y=8) since the agent is already aligned. Then, move the agent to reach the cyan KeyDoor (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is holding a Key and at x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. After that, move onto the KeyDoor to open it and destroy the Key. Finally, move to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. The agent is already at x=18 after opening the KeyDoor, so it must move RIGHT only 1 time.",
