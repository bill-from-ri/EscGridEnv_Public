Next, move the agent to pick up the yellow Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. After picking up the Key, the agent will be purple and able to open the cyan KeyDoor. Move the agent to reach the cyan KeyDoor (x=18) by moving RIGHT. The agent is already at y=8, so no vertical movement is needed. Because the agent is at x=13 after picking up the Key, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Once the agent opens the KeyDoor, move DOWN to reach the goal (y=11). Because the agent is at y=8, it must move DOWN 11 - 8 = 3 times. Finally, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. The agent will be at x=18 after opening the KeyDoor, so it must move RIGHT 1 time.",
