Pick up the yellow Key by moving RIGHT to reach the key (x=13) because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Next, hold the Key and align the agent on the vertical axis (y=9) by moving DOWN. Because the agent is at y=8, it must move DOWN 1 time. Then, while holding the Key, move the agent to reach the cyan KeyDoor (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 5 times. Next, move onto the cyan KeyDoor to open it and destroy the Key. Finally, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=18, it must move RIGHT 1 time.",
