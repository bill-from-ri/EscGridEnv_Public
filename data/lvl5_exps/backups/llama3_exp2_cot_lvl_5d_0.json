Because the agent is at y=8, it must move DOWN 11 - 8 = 3 times. Next, move to pick up the yellow Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, while holding the Key (as purple), move RIGHT to reach the cyan KeyDoor. Because the agent is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Next, move UP onto the KeyDoor to open it and destroy the Key. Finally, move RIGHT to reach the goal (x=19). Because the agent is at x=18, it must move RIGHT 19 - 18 = 1 time.",
