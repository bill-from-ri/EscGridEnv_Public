Because the cyan object is a KeyDoor, and the yellow object is a Key, the agent must first pick up the Key by moving to the yellow object at (13, 8) on the same horizontal axis (y=8). Next, move the agent to reach the Key at x=13 by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, hold the Key and move to the KeyDoor at (18, 8) on the same horizontal axis (y=8). Next, move the agent to reach the KeyDoor at x=18 by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is already holding the Key and has moved past the yellow object, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times more. Then, because the agent is holding the Key and standing on the KeyDoor, the door opens, and the Key is destroyed. Finally, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=18, it must move RIGHT 1 time.",
