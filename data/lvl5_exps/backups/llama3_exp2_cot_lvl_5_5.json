Next, move the agent to reach the key (x=13) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, pick up the Key by moving into its space. The agent will be colored purple after picking up the Key. Next, move the agent to reach the KeyDoor (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=13 after picking up the Key, it must move RIGHT 5 times. Then, open the KeyDoor by moving onto it. Finally, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=18 after opening the KeyDoor, it must move RIGHT 1 time.",
