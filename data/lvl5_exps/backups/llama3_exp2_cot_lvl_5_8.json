Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, move DOWN to align on the horizontal axis (y=8) since the agent and key are already aligned. Next, move the agent to reach the cyan KeyDoor by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is currently at x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Move onto the KeyDoor to open it, then destroy the Key. Finally, move RIGHT again to reach the goal (x=19) because the agent is now at x=18. It must move RIGHT 1 time.",
