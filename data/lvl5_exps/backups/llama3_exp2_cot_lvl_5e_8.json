Because the agent is at y=8 and the goal is at y=12, the agent must move DOWN 4 times to align on the vertical axis (y=12). Next, because there is a KeyDoor at (18, 8), the agent must pick up the yellow Key at (13, 8) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 8 times. Then, move onto the cyan object to open the KeyDoor and destroy the Key. Finally, move to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=18 after opening the door, it must move RIGHT 1 time.",
