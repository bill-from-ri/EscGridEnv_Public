Then, move DOWN 0 times since we are already at y=8. Next, move to the cyan KeyDoor location (x=18, y=8) by moving RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Since the agent is holding the key, it will open the KeyDoor and destroy the Key. Then, move DOWN 2 times to reach the goal (y=10). Finally, move RIGHT 1 time to reach the goal (x=19).",
