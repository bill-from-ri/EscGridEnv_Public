Because the agent must pick up the yellow Key to open the cyan KeyDoor, align the agent on the horizontal axis (y=8) by doing nothing since it's already aligned. Next, move the agent to reach the yellow Key (x=13) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, pick up the Key by moving into its space. After picking up the Key, move towards the cyan KeyDoor (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Next, open the KeyDoor by moving onto it. Then, align the agent on the vertical axis (y=10) by moving DOWN. Because the agent is now at y=8, it must move DOWN 10 - 8 = 2 times. Finally, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=18, it must move RIGHT 19 - 18 = 1 time.",
