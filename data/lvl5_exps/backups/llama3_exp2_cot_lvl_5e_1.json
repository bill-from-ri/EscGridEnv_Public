Next, move the agent to pick up the yellow Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, move DOWN to reach the cyan KeyDoor while holding the Key. Because the agent is currently at y=8, it must move DOWN 8 - 8 = 0 times (no movement needed). Move onto the KeyDoor to open it and destroy the Key. Finally, move UP to reach the goal (y=12) by moving UP. Because the agent is at y=8, it must move UP 12 - 8 = 4 times. Then, move RIGHT to reach the goal (x=19). Because the agent is currently at x=18 after opening the KeyDoor, it must move RIGHT 19 - 18 = 1 time.",
