Since there's a cyan object (KeyDoor) blocking the path to the goal, the agent needs to pick up the yellow object (Key) to open the KeyDoor. Align the agent on the horizontal axis (y=8) by not moving, as it's already at y=8. Next, move the agent to reach the yellow object (x=13) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, pick up the Key by moving into its space. Now that the agent has the Key, move back to the opening of the enclosure (x=18) by moving LEFT. Because the agent will be at x=13 after picking up the Key, it must move LEFT 13 - 18 = -5 times. Next, move DOWN to reach the same y-axis as the cyan object (y=8). Then, move RIGHT to open the KeyDoor and destroy the Key by moving onto the cyan object. Finally, move UP to reach the goal (x=19, y=10) by first moving UP 2 times, then move RIGHT 1 time.",
