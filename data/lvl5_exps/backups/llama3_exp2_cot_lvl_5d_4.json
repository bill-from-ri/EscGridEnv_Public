Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, move DOWN to align with the cyan KeyDoor (y=8). Since the agent is already at y=8, no action is needed. Next, move RIGHT to reach the KeyDoor (x=18) and open it by moving onto the cyan object. Because the agent is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 5 times. Then, move DOWN to align with the green Goal object (y=11). Because the agent was previously at y=8, it must move DOWN 3 times. Finally, move RIGHT to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=18, it must move RIGHT 1 time.",
