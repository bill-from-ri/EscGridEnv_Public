The agent does not need to move vertically. Next, move the agent to reach the yellow object (x=13) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, pick up the Key by moving into its space. Now the agent is purple and holding the Key. Move the agent to reach the cyan object (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is currently at x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Move onto the cyan object to open the KeyDoor and destroy the Key. Finally, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=18, it must move RIGHT 19 - 18 = 1 time.",
