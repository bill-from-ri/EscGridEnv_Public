Next, move the agent to reach the yellow Key (x=13) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, pick up the Key by moving into its space. After picking up the Key, align the agent on the vertical axis (x=18) with the cyan KeyDoor by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=13 after picking up the Key, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Next, open the KeyDoor by moving onto it. Then, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=18, it must move RIGHT 19 - 18 = 1 time.",
