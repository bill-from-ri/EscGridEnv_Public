The agent does not need to move in the vertical direction. Next, move the agent to reach the yellow object (x=13) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Pick up the Key by moving into its space. Then, move the agent to align with the cyan object on the horizontal axis (y=8). The agent does not need to move in the vertical direction. Next, move the agent to reach the cyan object (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=13 and it moved 8 steps right, it must move RIGHT 5 more times. Move onto the cyan object to open the KeyDoor and destroy the Key. Finally, move the agent to align with the green object on the horizontal axis (y=11). The agent needs to move UP 3 times since y=8 and y=11 have a difference of 3. Next, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=18, it must move RIGHT 1 time.",
