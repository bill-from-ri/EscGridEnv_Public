Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Next, align the agent on the vertical axis (y=10) by moving UP. Because the agent is at y=8, it must move UP 10 - 8 = 2 times. Then, move to reach the cyan KeyDoor at (18, 8) by moving RIGHT. The agent will open the KeyDoor and destroy the Key. Next, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=18, it must move RIGHT 19 - 18 = 1 time.",
