While holding the Key, the agent is colored purple. Next, move the agent to reach the cyan KeyDoor (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is already at x=13 after picking up the Key, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Move DOWN to align with the KeyDoor (y=8). Now that the agent has the Key and is in front of the KeyDoor, move onto the cyan object to open it. Finally, move UP and then RIGHT to reach the green Goal object.",
