Because there is a cyan KeyDoor at (18, 8) blocking the path to the goal, and a yellow Key at (13, 8), align the agent on the horizontal axis (x=13) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, pick up the yellow Key by moving into its space. The agent will be colored purple. Next, move the agent to reach the cyan KeyDoor (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Move onto the cyan object to open the door and destroy the Key. Finally, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=18, it must move RIGHT 19 - 18 = 1 time.",
