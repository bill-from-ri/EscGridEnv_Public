Next, move to pick up the yellow Key (x=13) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, move to align with the cyan KeyDoor on the horizontal axis (y=8) by not moving since the agent is already at y=8. Next, move to reach the cyan KeyDoor (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Then, move onto the cyan KeyDoor to open it and destroy the Key. Finally, move to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=18, it must move RIGHT 19 - 18 = 1 time.",
