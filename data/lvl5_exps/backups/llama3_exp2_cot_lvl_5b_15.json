Next, move to the yellow Key object (x=13) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then pick up the Key by moving into its space. Now move to the cyan KeyDoor object (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Open the KeyDoor and destroy the Key. Finally, move to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. The agent is already at x=18 so it only needs to move RIGHT 1 time.",
