Since there is a cyan KeyDoor at (18, 8) which blocks the path to the goal, the agent must pick up the yellow Key at (13, 8) first. Align the agent on the horizontal axis (x=13) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, move DOWN to reach the key (y=8). Next, pick up the Key by moving into its space. Now, while holding the Key, move RIGHT to reach the cyan KeyDoor at (18, 8) and open it. Finally, move to reach the goal (x=19, y=11) by moving DOWN 11 - 8 = 3 times and then RIGHT 1 time.",
