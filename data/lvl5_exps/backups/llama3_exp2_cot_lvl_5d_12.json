Then, move DOWN to align with the cyan KeyDoor on the horizontal axis (y=8). Next, move the agent onto the cyan KeyDoor to open it and destroy the Key. Move UP to reach the opening in the enclosure at (18, 8). Because the agent is currently at y=8, it does not need to move up or down. Finally, move RIGHT to reach the goal (x=19) by moving through the opening. Because the agent is at x=18 after passing the KeyDoor, it must move RIGHT 1 time.",
