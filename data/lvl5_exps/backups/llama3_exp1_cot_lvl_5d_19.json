    "solve_plan": "First determine that the green object is the Goal object. Align the agent on the vertical axis (y=11) by moving DOWN or UP. Because the agent is at y=8 and the goal is at y=11, it must move DOWN 11 - 8 = 3 times. Next, align the agent on the horizontal axis (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 19 - 5 = 14 times. However, there's an obstruction at (13, 8), so the agent needs to navigate around it. Move DOWN to y=7 to avoid the obstacle, then move RIGHT to x=13, and finally move UP to y=8 again. Now the agent can continue moving RIGHT to reach the goal.",
