Since the green object is located at (19, 9) and the agent is currently at (5, 8), I need to align the agent on the vertical axis (y=9) by moving DOWN. Because the agent is at y=8, it must move DOWN 1 time. Next, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 14 times.",
