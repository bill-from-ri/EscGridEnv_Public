Because the agent needs to reach the cyan object (KeyDoor) first, align the agent on the horizontal axis (y=8) by doing nothing since it's already aligned. Next, move the agent to reach the yellow object (Key) at (x=13) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, pick up the Key by moving into its space. Now, while holding the Key, align the agent on the horizontal axis (y=8) again by doing nothing since it's already aligned. Next, move the agent to reach the cyan object (KeyDoor) at (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Then, open the KeyDoor and destroy the Key by moving onto it. Now, align the agent on the vertical axis (x=19) by moving UP. Because the agent is at y=8, it must move UP 11 - 8 = 3 times. Finally, move to reach the goal (y=11) by doing nothing since it's already aligned.",
