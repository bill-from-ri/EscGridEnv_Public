    "solve_plan": "First determine that the green object is the Goal object. Align the agent on the horizontal axis (y=10) by moving UP or DOWN. Because the agent is at y=8 and the goal is at y=10, it must move UP 10 - 8 = 2 times. Next, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 19 - 5 = 14 times, but since there's an obstacle at (18, 8), it needs to move around it first. So, move DOWN 1 time, then move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times, then move UP 1 time, and finally move RIGHT 6 times.",
