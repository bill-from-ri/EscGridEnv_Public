Align the agent on the horizontal axis (y=8) because it's already aligned. Next, move the agent to reach the Key (x=13) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, pick up the Key by moving into its space. After picking up the Key, move LEFT back to the opening in the enclosure at (18, 8). Move DOWN one space to align with the cyan object (KeyDoor) on the vertical axis (x=18). Next, move the agent onto the KeyDoor to open it and destroy the Key. Finally, move UP one space to reach the goal (x=19, y=9) by moving UP and then RIGHT.",
