Next, move to pick up the yellow Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, while holding the Key, move to reach the cyan KeyDoor by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Once on the KeyDoor, it will open and the Key will be destroyed. Finally, move DOWN to align with the green Goal object, which is one space below, so move DOWN 1 time. Then, move RIGHT to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT 1 time.",
