Next, move the agent to reach the yellow object (x=13) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, pick up the Key by moving onto the yellow object. After picking up the Key, move the agent to reach the cyan object (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is already holding the Key and the cyan object is a KeyDoor, it will open when the agent moves onto it. Finally, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT.",
