Because there is a cyan object (KeyDoor) blocking the path to the goal, the agent must first pick up the yellow object (Key). Move RIGHT 8 times to reach the Key. Then, move UP 0 times because the agent is already at y=8. Pick up the Key by moving into its space. The agent will be colored purple now. Next, move LEFT 8 times and DOWN 2 times to align with the cyan object (KeyDoor) on both axes. Move RIGHT 1 time to reach the KeyDoor. Because the agent is holding the Key, the KeyDoor opens, and the Key is destroyed. Then, move DOWN 2 times and RIGHT 1 time to align with the goal object on both axes. Finally, move UP 0 times because the agent is already at y=10.",
