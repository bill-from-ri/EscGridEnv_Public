Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. After picking up the key, the agent will be colored purple. Next, move DOWN to align with the cyan object on the vertical axis (y=8). Then, move RIGHT to reach the KeyDoor (x=18) and open it. Finally, move UP to reach the goal (x=19, y=9). Because the agent is at x=18 and y=8, it must move RIGHT 1 time and then move UP 1 time.",
