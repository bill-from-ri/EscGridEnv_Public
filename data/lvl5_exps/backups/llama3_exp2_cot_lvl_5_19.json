Next, pick up the yellow Key by moving RIGHT to reach the key (x=13). Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, move the agent to reach the cyan KeyDoor (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. After picking up the key and reaching the KeyDoor, move onto the KeyDoor to open it. Finally, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=18, it must move RIGHT 1 time.",
