Because the cyan object is a KeyDoor at (18, 8) and the goal object is at (19, 9), the agent must obtain the yellow Key to open the KeyDoor. Align the agent on the horizontal axis (x=13) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Next, pick up the Key by moving DOWN. Because the agent and the Key are at the same y-coordinate (y=8), no movement in the y-direction is needed. Then, move to the KeyDoor at (18, 8) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent has moved to x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Next, open the KeyDoor by moving DOWN. Because the agent and the KeyDoor are at the same y-coordinate (y=8), no movement in the y-direction is needed. Finally, move to reach the goal (x=19, y=9) by first moving UP once, then moving RIGHT once.",
