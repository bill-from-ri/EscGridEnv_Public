Because the agent is at y=8 and the goal is at y=11, it must move DOWN 11 - 8 = 3 times. Next, align the agent on the horizontal axis (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 14 times and then move RIGHT 4 more times to reach the goal, avoiding the cyan object at (18, 8). Finally, move UP 1 time to enter the cell with the green object.",
