Because the cyan object is a KeyDoor and the yellow object is a Key, align the agent on the horizontal axis (y=8) since all objects are at y=8. Next, move the agent to pick up the Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, while holding the Key, move the agent to reach the KeyDoor (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=13 after picking up the Key, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Finally, move onto the KeyDoor to open it and then move onto the Goal object by moving RIGHT.",
