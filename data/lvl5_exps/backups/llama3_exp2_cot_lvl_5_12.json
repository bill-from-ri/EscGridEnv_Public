Since there is a cyan KeyDoor at (18, 8), we need to obtain the yellow Key first by moving RIGHT to reach x=13 and then move DOWN to align with y=8. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then move DOWN once to align with y=8. Next, pick up the yellow Key by moving into its space. Now that we have the Key, we can open the cyan KeyDoor by moving RIGHT to reach x=18 and then move UP to align with y=8. Because the agent is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 5 times. Then move DOWN once to align with y=8. Finally, move RIGHT once to reach the goal (x=19).",
