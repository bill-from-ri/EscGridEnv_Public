To do this, the agent must pick up the yellow Key at (13, 8). Align the agent on the horizontal axis (x=13) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, move DOWN to reach the key. After picking up the Key, the agent will be colored purple. Next, align the agent on the horizontal axis (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the current x-position is 13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Then, move DOWN to reach the cyan KeyDoor. When the agent moves onto the KeyDoor, it opens and the Key is destroyed. Finally, move RIGHT to reach the goal (x=19).",
