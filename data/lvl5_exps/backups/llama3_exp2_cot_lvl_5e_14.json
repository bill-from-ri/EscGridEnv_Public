Next, move the agent to pick up the Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5 and the yellow object is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Now, while holding the Key (agent is purple), move DOWN to align with the cyan object (y=8) since the cyan object is at y=8. Next, move the agent to reach the KeyDoor by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=13 and the cyan object is at x=18, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. When the agent reaches the KeyDoor, the door opens, and the Key is destroyed. Finally, move UP to align with the green object (y=12) since the green object is at y=12. Next, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=18 and the green object is at x=19, it must move RIGHT 1 time.",
