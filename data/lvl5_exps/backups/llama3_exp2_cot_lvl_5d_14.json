Then, move to pick up the Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5 and the yellow object is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. After picking up the Key, the agent will be colored purple. Next, move to reach the cyan object (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Then, move DOWN to align with the green object on the vertical axis (y=11). Because the agent is at y=8, it must move DOWN 11 - 8 = 3 times. Finally, move RIGHT to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=18, it must move RIGHT 19 - 18 = 1 time.",
