Because there is a cyan KeyDoor at (18, 8) with an opening in the enclosure, and a yellow Key at (13, 8), align the agent on the horizontal axis (y=8) by doing nothing since it's already aligned. Next, move the agent to pick up the Key (x=13) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, move the agent to reach the cyan object (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is already at x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. After that, since the KeyDoor will open and the Key will be destroyed, move DOWN 3 times to align on the vertical axis (y=11). Finally, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT.",
