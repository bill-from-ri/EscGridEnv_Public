Determine that the agent needs to align itself on the vertical axis with the goal object by moving DOWN. Since the agent is currently at y=8 and the goal object is at y=11, it must move DOWN 11 - 8 = 3 times. Next, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is currently at x=5, it must move RIGHT 19 - 5 = 14 times.",
