Next, move the agent to pick up the yellow Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5 and the yellow key is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, while holding the purple Key, move the agent to reach the cyan KeyDoor (x=18) by moving RIGHT. It's already on y=8 so no vertical movement needed. Once the KeyDoor opens, move DOWN one space to align with the green Goal object. Finally, move RIGHT one space to reach the goal (x=19).",
