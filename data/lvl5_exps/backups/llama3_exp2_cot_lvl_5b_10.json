Next, move the agent to pick up the yellow key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5 and the key is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, while holding the Key, move the agent to reach the cyan KeyDoor (x=18) by moving RIGHT again. Because the agent will be at x=13 after picking up the Key, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. This action will open the KeyDoor and destroy the Key. Finally, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19, y=9) by moving UP once and then moving RIGHT once.",
