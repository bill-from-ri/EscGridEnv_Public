Next, move the agent to pick up the Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, align the agent on the vertical axis (x=18) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Next, move the agent to open the KeyDoor and destroy the Key by moving RIGHT. Finally, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving UP.",
