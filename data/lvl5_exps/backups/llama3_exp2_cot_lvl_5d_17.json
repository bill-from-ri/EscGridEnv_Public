Since there is a cyan KeyDoor at (18, 8) which blocks the path to the goal, and there is a yellow Key at (13, 8), we need to pick up the Key first. Move RIGHT to reach the Key by moving RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, move UP to align with the KeyDoor on the vertical axis (y=8). Since the agent is already at y=8, no movement is needed. Next, move onto the cyan object to open it and then move DOWN to align with the green object on the horizontal axis (y=11). Because the agent is at y=8, it must move DOWN 11 - 8 = 3 times. Finally, move RIGHT to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT 19 - 18 = 1 time.",
