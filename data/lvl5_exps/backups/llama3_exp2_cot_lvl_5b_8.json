Since there is an opening in the enclosure at (18, 8), we need to align the agent on the horizontal axis (y=8) by not doing anything because it's already aligned. Next, move the agent to pick up the Key by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is at x=5 and the yellow object is at x=13, it must move RIGHT 13 - 5 = 8 times. Then, move the agent to reach the KeyDoor by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=13, it must move RIGHT 18 - 13 = 5 times. Now that the agent has the Key and is in front of the KeyDoor, it can open the KeyDoor by moving RIGHT once. Finally, move the agent to reach the goal (x=19) by moving RIGHT. Because the agent is now at x=18, it must move RIGHT 19 - 18 = 1 time.",
